# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview 
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We will use data visualizations to present our findings to the board.

## Summary

-	Used the Elbow Curve to find the best values for k which is 4 in this case.
-	Generated 3D-Scatter with Clusters to Visualize Cryptocurrencies Results
-	Created a table to show all tradable Cryptocurrencies
-	Create a Scatter plot using x="TotalCoinsMined" and y="TotalCoinSupply"
